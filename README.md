Data-Driven Financial Analysis for Retail Business

This project focuses on applying data-driven techniques to analyze the financial performance of a retail business. The objective is to understand revenue and profit patterns, evaluate inventory efficiency, assess credit risk, and provide actionable recommendations to improve profitability, cash flow, and operational stability.

Project Overview

The project involved analyzing transactional and credit data over a multi-month period.
Key analytical methods included:

Time-series analysis to study daily revenue and profit trends

Statistical analysis to understand variability and distribution of financial performance

ABC analysis to identify high-revenue product categories

Inventory turnover and fast–slow moving item analysis

Credit risk analysis to evaluate repayment behavior and outstanding balances

The study also examined wastage patterns, expiry risks, and margin–profit relationships.

Data Collection

Two main datasets were used:

Sales & Inventory Data
Includes:

Date, day, and product category

Quantity sold and purchased

Unit prices, revenue, and profit

Wastage percentage and expiry details

Credit Data
Includes:

House/flat-wise credit taken

Amount repaid

Outstanding balance

Repayment percentage

Interest cost

Risk and behavior scores

Analysis Methods

The following techniques were applied:

Time-Series Analysis – To identify trends in revenue and profit

Descriptive Statistics – Mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, etc.

ABC Analysis – To classify categories based on revenue contribution

Inventory Turnover Analysis – To identify fast and slow-moving items

Credit Risk Analysis – To assess repayment behavior and exposure

Regression Analysis – To study the relationship between margin and profit

Results and Recommendations

The analysis revealed:

Stable daily revenue with predictable peaks and dips

A few product categories contribute most of the revenue

Certain items move slowly and increase wastage risk

Credit exposure is concentrated among a few households

High outstanding balances impact cash flow and interest costs

Key recommendations include:

Optimizing inventory based on demand patterns

Expanding high-margin product variety

Improving wastage control for slow-moving items

Implementing structured credit limits and repayment tracking

Strengthening weekday sales strategies
